        Soil pollution is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals (pollutants or contaminants) in soil, in high enough concentrations to pose a risk to human health and/or the ecosystem.
        In the case of contaminants which occur naturally in soil, even when their levels are not high enough to pose a risk,
        soil pollution is still said to occur if the levels of the contaminants in soil exceed the levels that should naturally be present.

        Humans can be affected by soil pollution through the inhalation of gases emitted from soils moving upward, or through the inhalation of matter that is disturbed and transported by the wind because of the various human activities on the ground.
        Soil pollution may cause a variety of health problems, starting with headaches, nausea, fatigue, skin rash, <br>
        eye irritation and potentially resulting in more serious conditions like neuromuscular blockage, kidney and liver damage and various forms of cancer
