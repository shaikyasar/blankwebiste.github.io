        Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the
        propagation of noise with ranging impacts on the activity of human or
        animal life, most of them harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise
        worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems.

    Our oceans are no longer quiet. Thousands of oil drills, sonars, seismic survey devices, coastal
    recreational watercraft and shipping vessels are now populating our waters, and that is a serious
    cause of noise pollution for marine life. Whales are among the most affected, as their hearing
    helps them orient themselves, feed and communicate. Noise pollution thus interferes with cetaceans (whales and dolphins) feeding habits, reproductive patterns and migration routes, and can even cause hemorrhage and death.

    Other than marine life, land animals are also affected by noise pollution in the form of traffic,
    firecrackers etc., and birds are especially affected by the increased air traffic.
